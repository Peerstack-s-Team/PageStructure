                The most important moment of your life is now. The most
                important person in your life is the one you are with now, and
                the most important activity in your life is the one you are
                involved with now. The smaller your reality, the more convinced
                you are that you know everything. This, too, will pass. The past
                has no power over the present moment. Peace comes from within.
                Do not seek it without.

                You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by
                your anger. The smaller your reality, the more convinced you are
                that you know everything. Peace comes from within. Do not seek
                it without. The smaller your reality, the more convinced you are
                that you know everything. The smaller your reality, the more
                convinced you are that you know everything. If the facts don't
                fit the theory, change the facts.
