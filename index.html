          The past has no power over the present moment. Peace comes from
          within. Do not seek it without. The smaller your reality, the more
          convinced you are that you know everything.

          The most important moment of your life is now. The most important
          person in your life is the one you are with now, and the most
          important activity in your life is the one you are involved with now.
          Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.

          punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger. This,
